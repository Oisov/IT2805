            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The purpose of a server in the client server architecture is
                to host one or more server programswhich share their resources
                with clients
                <li>Unlike the server a client does not share any of it's
                    resources, but requests a server's content or service function.
                </li>
                <li>An internet Protocil adress is a numerical label assigned to
                    each device connected to a computer network.
                </li>
                <li>The Domain Name System (or DNS for short) is a central part
                    of the internet, providing a way to match website names to
                    numbers. Everything connected to the internet has an IP
                    adress made up of numbers
                </li>
                <li>The difference between the internet and WWW is that internet
                    is short for intern network. So every collection of
                    computers sharing information over a local network is using
                    the internet. WWW on the other hand is a global internet,
                    where every computer is connected.
                </li>
                <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML for short) is the basic
                    building block of the web. It is a simple way of creating
                    and linking togheter webpages.
