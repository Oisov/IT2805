1. What is the difference between "position: absolute" and "position: fixed"?

   Fixed elements are independent of everything else on the web page. Regardless
   of any parents, a fixed position element will always be positioned based on
   the browser window. Even when the page is scrolled fixed elements stay and
   are visible.

   An absolutely element is positioned based on its nearest relatively
   positioned parent element. The position of the absolute element is determined
   by its parent elements.
   
   

2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?

   Assume that the first element is called e1, and the second element e2. Then

   e1 > e2:nth-child(3) {

   }

   will style the third element within another element regardless of type.
