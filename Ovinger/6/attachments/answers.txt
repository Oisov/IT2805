1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in
   Javascript?

Because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for Math, it makes use of 64-bit
floating numbers. This means that

This causes precision errors when doing floating point
(decimal) calculations. So we actually have

          0.1 + 0.2 = 0.300000004,

which is not equal to 0.3. One solution is to use (0.1 + 0.2).toFixed(1) to
force the number of decimals to precicely 1.

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element
   is changed to GET ?

Because that is the purpose of GET? This means the submitt page can be
bookmarked or cached. It also makes the GET requests remain in browser history.

4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5
   and/or Javascript?

Validate form input with HTML5 and or Javascript are examples of client-side
validation. The main drawback of client-side validation is that it relies on
JavaScript. If users turn JavaScript off, they can easily bypass the validation.

The best practice is to use both client-side and server-side validation. In the
server-side validation, information is being sent to the server and validated
using one of server-side languages. If the validation fails, the response is
then sent back to the client, page that contains the web form is refreshed and a
feedback is shown. This method is secure because it will work even if JavaScript
is turned off in the browser and it canâ€™t be easily bypassed by malicious users.
